# CPE_NodeAngJEE_Project
School project aiming to develop a presentation app using NodeJS , Angular, JEE Web , JEE EJB ,REST.

The main objectiv was to develop a web-based presentation application.
We developped the possibility to  have an admin to create and play a presentation. A spectator can connect to the server and watch the presentation without the admin tools ( such as next or previous slid for example ). The spectator is connected to the presentation in real time with the server thanks to the socket.io.
